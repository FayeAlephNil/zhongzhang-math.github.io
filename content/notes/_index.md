[Here](thesis_milnor_number.pdf) is my master thesis on Milnor numbers of complex hypersurfaces, under the supervision of Mona Merling and Thomas Brazelton.

[Here](the_adams_conjecture_and_the_k_theory_of_finite_fields.pdf) is an expository paper on the Adams conjecture and the K-theory of finite fields that I wrote with Matthew Niemiro for UChicago Math REU 2022.
