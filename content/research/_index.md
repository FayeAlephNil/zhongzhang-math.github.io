Abstract: We classify representations of the mapping class group of a surface of genus g (with at
most one puncture or boundary component) up to dimension 3g − 3. Any such representation is the
direct sum of a representation in dimension 2g or 2g + 1 (given as the action on the (co)homology
of the surface or its unit tangent bundle) with a trivial representation. As a corollary, any linear
system on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus g in this range is of algebro-geometric
origin.
